# Test code classification

Research on the impacts of implementing test code in software repositories has brought improvements to software development.

This repository contains a test code classification implementation based on the proposal by Gonzalez (Gonzalez et al., 2017), see more details in the references. This classification allows us to perform various analyzes on software repositories, such as test distribution, test evolution, or making associations with other project characteristics.

This repository aims to promote the investigation of tests using the test classification proposed by Gonzalez ( Gonzalez et al., 2017), as well as keeping the dictionary used in the classification of tests up to date.

How to run
- Clone this repository
